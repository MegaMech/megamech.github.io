<p style="font-size: 30px; padding-left: 52px; padding-right: 10px;">Canadian pianist and composer Alex Windsor holds a pending Bachelor of Music in piano degree from the University of Alberta. Alex has many years of ensemble experience with tenor/alto saxophone, flute, and in choirs.
  <br><br>Alex's thorough academic study of piano musicology results in an evidential approach to piano performance practice.
  <br>Applying improvisation to Baroque keyboard technique generates stylistically unique performances. An element often ignored.
  <br>He studied the Maelzel Metronome and its related issues and can substantiate several solutions to choosing tempi in Beethoven's piano sonatas.
  <br>Alex thoughtfully constructs information so students can translate words to muscle movements in an easy manner.
