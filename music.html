    <br><h3>Chorale Book</h3>
    <br>A new chorale book for concert band with a website (chorales.alexwindsor.ca) containing academically accurate supplemental information.
    <br>This book will contain a wider collection of chorales than other books. This helps keep the band interested with a wide-range of simple to complex pieces to play.
    <br>It also allows students to gain a wider perspective of the chorale and how it has developed over the past few hundred years.
