    A monthly group piano lesson may be organized as a performance opportunity for students. In it students perform for each other and family members.
    An invaluable event for students to inspire each other, become more accustomed to playing in-front of people and performing on a grand piano.
    These will typically begin with a short lecture regarding a composer, a piano style, or any sort of musical information relevant to the students.

  <h2>What to expect</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5">
  Length of lessons are an hour or half an hour. Advanced students should consider the hour long lessons.<br><br>
  Each week students are asked to do one short home-work activity. These activities will consist of music listening, sight-reading, music theory, music history, or researching one of their music pieces. 
  Students will communicate their thoughts regarding the weeks music listening via e-mail.<br>
  Generally, piano students should prepare a minimum of four pieces per school year or per half a school year depending on individual progress and length of pieces.
  New students will learn or review keyboard technique; the approach to pressing the keys. Concepts often lacking in beginner and advanced pianists.
  Students improvising at home is strongly encouraged due to its relation to music composition. Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, and many others were great improvisers.

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5">
    Students will follow RCM piano technique with supplemental Bartok and Dohn√°nyi piano exercises. Selected music will come from a variety of sources: RCM, IMSLP.org, and urtext.
    Beginner piano students will need a Bastien Piano Basics book. Students that can already read sheet music will need an RCM book and access to IMSLP.org and a printer.<br>
    Students will also need a pencil, eraser, and possibly a highlighter.<br><br>
    Clearer details of what to purchase will be discussed at the first lesson.

  <h2>Instruction Philosophy <span style="font-size: 16px"><i>Balancing fun, creativity, and intensity</i></span></h2>
  
  <p style="max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5">
    Alex implements a variety of instructional methodologies flexibly to provide effective and efficient music lessons. Ultimately, one preeminent concept ascends all others; musicians require the crucial trait of musicality. Musicality transforms mechanical motion and sonic waves into music. 
    A musician cannot simply press the keys, they need to feel and fully-comprehend a composer's musical intentions so that they can transfer those aspects into their playing. 
    The most compelling approach to achieve this idea is singing musical phrases.<br><br>
    Alex strives to provide answers to students questions based on evidence and academic research. 
    The traditional piano instructor provides knowledge derived from prior instructors. A <i>word of mouth</i> practice. 
    This style has a tendency to distribute some amount of inaccurate or misrepresented information, normally regarding the lives of composers. 
    
    Instruction derived from recognized musicologists and extant historical sources are much more robust which allows students to comprehend the internal aspects of music with security of accuracy,  
    and better memory retention. Again, this differs from the traditional authoritarian style where the student is only told what to do.
    Evidence-based learning accomplishes the following goals:</p>
    
  <ul style="font-size: 20px">
    <li>Knowledge set in a solid foundation which easily transfers to future opportunities.</li><br>
    <li>Develops critical thinking skills which permits students to come to their own conclusions.</li><br>
    <li>Allowing students to choose from a variety of valid performance methods.</li><br>
    <li>Exploring realistic perspectives of composers and their life stories.</li><br>
    <li>Discovering possible answers to questions regarding complex topics.</li></ul>
    
  <br><br>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; max-width: 800px">
  Students in the modern musical universe are entangled in an enormous piano repertoire from many composers and musical styles. 
  This means aspiring pianists often do not have time to compose, experiment, and play their own music. 
  In the 1800s, improvisation equaled in importance to performance. 
  Today the development of this skill is disregarded despite it being crucial to many composers compositional style. 
  Alex promotes students' musical creativity.

  It can be difficult to translate words to muscle movements. As such Alex's approach to instruction includes communicating in a thoughtful manner that helps students learn quicker.
