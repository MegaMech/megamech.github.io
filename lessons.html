  <h3>Instruction Philosophy</h3>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5">
    Alex strives to provide answers to students questions based on evidence and academic research. 
    Traditional instructors base their knowledge from prior instructors which result in performance practice deriving from <i>word of mouth</i> practices. 
    This style limits instructors from providing evidence-based answers resulting in students containing insecure or incorrect knowledge. 
    
    Answers framed in the style of an academic argument are much more robust allowing students to comprehend the internal aspects of music 
    which allows better memory retention of significant information. This differs from the traditional authoritarian style where the student is only told what to do.
    Evidence-based learning accomplishes the following goals:</p>
    
  <ul style="font-size: 20px"><li>Allowing students to choose from a variety of valid performance methods.</li>
    <li>Exploring realistic perspectives of composers and their life stories.</li>
    <li>Discovering possible answers to questions regarding complex topics.</li></ul>

  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; max-width: 800px">
  Students in the modern musical universe are entangled in an enormous piano repertoire from many composers and musical styles. 
  This means aspiring pianists often do not have time to compose, experiment, and play their own music. 
  In the 1800s, improvisation equaled in importance to performance. 
  Today the development of this skill is disregarded despite it being crucial to many composers compositional style. 
  Alex promotes students' musical creativity.

  It can be difficult to translate words to muscle movements. As such Alex's approach to instruction includes communicating in a thoughtful manner that helps students learn quicker.
