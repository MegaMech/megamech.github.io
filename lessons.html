    <h3>General comments regarding music instruction</h3>
    Many music instructors base their knowledge from prior instructors and as such have not necessarily studied significant issues in historical musics. 
    I have observed this in beginner instructors to conservatory and PhD level instructors. 
    Traditional word of mouth music instruction has the limitation that if a student desires to know the evidence for the answer to a question, 
    many the instructor may struggle to provide a suitable answer. The point is not condemn, 
  but to question how the student should gain playing confidence if they do not comprehend the music itself. 
  A good question for testing an instructors background knowledge is by asking <i>What tempo should <this> baroque piece be played at?</i>
  There exists many historical documents that can be cited and multiple answers consistent with academics and musicologists.<br>
  
  No instructor holds all the answers at their finger-tips, but many seemingly glaring questions are left unanswered. 
  As such, Alex advocates for evidence-based instruction and that instructors learn continously.

  It can be difficult to translate words to muscle movements. As such Alex's approach to instruction includes communicating in a thoughtful manner that helps students learn quicker.
