    <h3>Instruction Philosophy</h3>
  <p style="max-width: 650px;">
    Alex strives to provide answers to students questions based on evidence and academic research. 
    Traditional instructors base their knowledge from prior instructors which result in performance practice deriving from <i>word of mouth</i> practices. 
    This style limits instructors from providing evidence-based answers resulting in students containing insecure or incorrect knowledge. 
    
    Answers framed in the style of an academic argument are much more robust allowing students to comprehend the internal aspects of music 
    which allows better memory retention of significant information. Also, this style accomplishes the following goals: 
    
  <ul><li>More options regarding how a piece should be played and students having the ability to choose the style they enjoy.</li>
    <li>Realistic perspectives of composers and their life stories.</li>
    <li></li></ul>
    
  <br>
  
  No instructor holds all the answers at their finger-tips, but many seemingly glaring questions are left unanswered. 
  As such, Alex advocates for evidence-based instruction and that instructors learn continously.

  It can be difficult to translate words to muscle movements. As such Alex's approach to instruction includes communicating in a thoughtful manner that helps students learn quicker.
