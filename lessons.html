    There may be an opportunity for piano students in the form of a monthly group piano lesson. In it students perform for each other and family members.
    An invaluable event for students to inspire each other, become more accustomed to playing in-front of people and performing on a grand piano.
    These will typically begin with a short lecture regarding a composer, a piano style, or any sort of musical information relevant to the students.

  <h2>What to expect</h2>
  Length of lessons are an hour (preferable for advanced students) or half an hour. Each week students are asked to do one short home-work activity. 
  These activities will consist of music listening, sight-reading, music theory, music history, or researching one of their music pieces. 
  Thoughts regarding the weeks music listening will be communicated via e-mail. Sending Questions via e-mail are always welcome.<br>
  Generally, piano students should prepare a minimum of four pieces per school year or per half a school year depending on individual progress and length of pieces.
  New students will learn or review keyboard technique; the approach to pressing the keys. Concepts that beginner and advanced pianists struggle with.
  Students improvising at home is strongly encouraged. Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, and many others were great improvisers, a skill that is not longer taught which helps with composition.

    Alex strives to provide answers to students questions based on evidence and academic research. 
    The traditional piano instructor provides knowledge derived from prior instructors. A <i>word of mouth</i> practice. 
    This style has a tendency to distribute some amount of inaccurate or misrepresented information, normally regarding the lives of composers. 
    
    Instruction derived from recognized musicologists and extant historical sources are much more robust which allows students to comprehend the internal aspects of music with security of accuracy,  
    and better memory retention. This differs from the traditional authoritarian style where the student is only told what to do.
    Evidence-based learning accomplishes the following goals:</p>
    
  <ul style="font-size: 20px"><li>Allowing students to choose from a variety of valid performance methods.</li><br>
    <li>Exploring realistic perspectives of composers and their life stories.</li><br>
    <li>Discovering possible answers to questions regarding complex topics.</li></ul>
    
  <br><br>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; max-width: 800px">
  Students in the modern musical universe are entangled in an enormous piano repertoire from many composers and musical styles. 
  This means aspiring pianists often do not have time to compose, experiment, and play their own music. 
  In the 1800s, improvisation equaled in importance to performance. 
  Today the development of this skill is disregarded despite it being crucial to many composers compositional style. 
  Alex promotes students' musical creativity.

  It can be difficult to translate words to muscle movements. As such Alex's approach to instruction includes communicating in a thoughtful manner that helps students learn quicker.
